# Odin Recipes

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
Odin Recipes is a beginner-friendly project from **The Odin Project** designed to strengthen my understanding of **HTML structure and file management**.  
This project involves creating a simple recipe website where each recipe has its own page, linked from a main index page.

## ðŸš€ What I Learned & Demonstrated
By completing this project, I have:
- Gained **hands-on experience with HTML** by structuring multiple pages.
- Learned how to **link pages together** using `<a>` tags.
- Used **lists and images** to format content properly.
- Practiced **basic Git and GitHub workflows**, including:
  - Creating repositories
  - Cloning repositories using SSH
  - Making commits with clear messages
  - Pushing changes to GitHub

## ðŸ”¥ Self-Reflection (After Completing the Project)
Looking back, this project was more than just writing HTML. It was my **first real experience managing a project with Git**.  
At first, I found Git **confusing**, especially the process of cloning, committing, and pushing.  
But now, I fully understand the **importance of version control** and how it helps keep track of my progress.

I also realized that **committing frequently** makes it easier to track changes, and that working on a project step by step (instead of rushing) helps with better organization.

This project is just the beginning. Now that I have a **solid understanding of Git and HTML**, Iâ€™m ready to take on more complex challenges. ðŸš€
