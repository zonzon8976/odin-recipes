    <h2>üìå Description</h2>

    <p>
       <strong><em> Suya</em></strong> is an iconic Nigerian street food beloved for its spicy, nutty, and smoky flavor. Originally popularized in the northern regions of Nigeria, Suya has become a<strong><em> nationwide favorite</em></strong> that‚Äôs often served at gatherings, parties, and as a late-night snack. Typically made with thinly sliced beef, chicken, or goat, Suya is marinated in a unique spice blend known as<strong><em> ‚ÄúYaji,‚Äù</em></strong> which features roasted peanuts, chili pepper, ginger, and an array of aromatic seasonings.

<ul>
   <p> <li><strong> Choice of Meat: </strong>sliced beef, chicken, or goat (remove excess fat for best results).</li></p>
    <li><strong> Suya Spice (Yaji):</strong> A special blend of ground roasted peanuts, chili pepper, ginger, garlic powder, onion powder, and other spices.</li>
    <p><li><strong> Oil:</strong> A light coating of vegetable or peanut oil helps the spices adhere to the meat.</strong></li></p>

<h3>üë®‚Äçüç≥ Steps</h3>

<ol>
    <p><li><strong> Prepare the Spice Rub:</strong> Combine your ground roasted peanuts, chili pepper, ginger, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and other seasonings in a bowl to create a<strong> fragrant Suya spice mix.</strong></li></p>
    <li><strong>Marinate the Meat:</strong> Pat your meat slices dry and coat them generously with the spice mix. Drizzle a small amount of oil and massage it into the meat, ensuring every surface is coated.</li>
    <P><li><strong>Let It Rest:</strong> Allow the meat to marinate for at least<strong> 20 to 30 minutes</strong> ‚Äîor overnight in the fridge if possible‚Äîto let the flavors intensify.</li></P>
    <li><strong>Skewer & Grill:</strong> Thread the meat onto skewers and place them on a preheated grill (or broil them in the oven if a grill isn‚Äôt available). Cook for<strong> about 3 to 5 minutes on each side</strong>, brushing with oil if needed to keep them moist.</li>
    <p><Li><strong>Check for Doneness:</strong> Suya cooks fast due to its thin slices. Once the edges start to char slightly and the meat is cooked through, remove from the heat.</Li></p>
    <li><strong>Serve & Enjoy:</strong> Slide the juicy Suya off the skewers onto a platter. Top with<strong> sliced onions, fresh tomatoes</strong>, and a<strong> sprinkle of extra Yaji</strong> for an authentic touch.</li>
    <ul> <ul>
        <p><li><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Serve Suya<strong> piping hot</strong> with a side of<strong> cool cucumber slices</strong> or your favorite dipping sauce to balance the heat.</li></p>
    </ul></ul>
